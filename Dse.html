        <h1>Data Science Enginnering</h1>
        <h2>What is Data science?</h2>
        <p>Data science is a very unique and multidisciplinary branch. It involves other branches like Computer science, Statistics, biotech, biomedical engineering, computational mathematics. In the growing world, everyday a new technology is being developed. With the development of new technologies, bulk of data are also generating. Data scientists acquire and analyse enormous sets of organised and unstructured data. A data scientistâ€™s job entails a mix of computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They interpret the outcomes of data analysis, processing, and modelling to generate actionable plans for businesses and other organisations.</p>
        <p>The core data science subjects focus on data analytics, visualization, predictive modeling and analytics for data-driven decision making. Companies are using data science to build recommendation engines, and predicting user behaviour, and much more.
            It also consists of Industry-specific, custom-designed program electives on blockchain technologies, quantum computing, data forensics, data privacy, algorithmic trading, and data security.  Students can also opt for a minor specialization in either business, finance or healthcare analytics.
